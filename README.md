# Computer-vision
This repository contains projects related to Computer vision.

In this project, I used Python and OpenCV to find lane lines in the road images.

The following techniques are used:

Color Selection

Canny Edge Detection

Region of Interest Selection

Hough Transform Line Detection

Finally, I applied all the techniques to process video clips to find lane lines in them.
